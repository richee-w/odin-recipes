## Project: Recipes

From the Odin Project, an open source learning platform for web development.

I already have a reasonable understanding of HTML and CSS although my skills are
somewhat rusty. This project will help me to brush up on those skills. 

I have learned how to host a site on github and I am very pleased with
the implications of this.
