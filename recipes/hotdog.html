    <h2>Tasty Hot Dogs</h2>
    <p>This does involve using a frying pan for the chopped onions but one saving grace is that you can buy the
        onions
        already chopped. At i can in my local super market, your mileage may vary. I recommend you delay
        watching your
        Netflix movie until after cooking.</p>
